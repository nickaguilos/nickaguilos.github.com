			<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="subheading">Hello I'm Nick</p>

			<p>
				I’m a UI designer and a photographer. For the past 11 years I have been involved in designing interfaces for several companies. The latest of which is a car startup called AutoDeal, of which I am the head for the UI Design Team
			</p>

			<p>
				The aesthetic I pour into design is governed by simplification. Not because it is a trend, but because it is a necessity. Too many systems exist that are too cumbersome to use because they are overly complex. Simplicity is ultimately what solves the most complicated problems in any software, app, web page, and to an extent, life itself
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2016 I started diving deep into photography. I’ve honed in on adventure and landscape photos; being outdoors braving the elements, waiting to capture a new perspective of the world brings a smile to my face, hopefully yours too, once you see it
			</p>

			<p>
				I’ve never planned to become a photographer, I just fell into it. I guess you could call it a natural progression from design. It’s been great so far though and has definitely broadened by horizons 
			</p>

			<p>
				Me and my team just released a climbing film called Igbaras. A first of it’s kind in the Philippines. I hope you find time to download it.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have two golden retrievers—-Finn and Taco. They are clingy
